            <h2 id="history">History of Minecraft</h2>
                <p>Minecraft was initially created bt Markus "Notch" Persson, a Swedish game programmers. Persson has worked for King for over four years until 2009, when he began full-time development on Minecraft. His idea brewed from a game he was developing titled "RubyDung". With the first-person perspective, blocky visuals, and building elements from Infiniminer, and the RPG elements/base building from RubyDung, Minecraft was born.</p>
                <p>Markus stayed with the growing team at Mojang (he was the founding member) until September 2014, when Microsoft announced a $2.5 billion acquisition deal to purchase the company. From there, he decided to step away from game development. The lead designer of Minecraft since 2011 has been Jens "Jeb" Bergensten, who has been co-developing Minecraft with Persson since 2010, took the lead designer role in 2011, and assumed full creative control in 2014 upon Persson's departure.</p>
                <p>Java Edition is the original version of Minecraft and began development in 2009 with various Alphas and Betas leading through 2010 to the beginning of 2011. The full version, titled "1.0 - Adventure Update" released on November 18th 2011. Making Minecraft 14 years old from its initial conception, and 12 years old from its full public release.</p>

            <h2 id="vs">Survival vs. Creative</h2>
                <p>Creative mode offers unlimited resources for building and exploration. Hunger and health does not go down in creative mode. Creative is for anyone who wants a stress-free experience or to spend some time figuring out the basics. Though in creative you cannot earn achievements.</p>
                <p>Survival mode provides a better experience for players who value challenge, immersion, progression, and rewarding gameplay. It challenges players to gather resources, fend off hostile mobs, and manage their health and hunger while exploring the sandbox. Players gradually build their way up, unlocking new weapons, tools, materials, and abilities as they advance. You can earn achievements in survival mode.</p>
