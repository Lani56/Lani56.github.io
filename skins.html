            <h2>What Are Skins?</h2>
            <p>Skins are custom images that change the appearance of your in-game character. They allow players to express their creativity and personality by altering the character's look, from default skins like Steve and ALex to unique designs created by community. Skins are typically in PNG format and can be downloaded or uploaded to change your character's appearance in the game. Players can choose from a variety of skins, including those inspired by popular culture or characters, and even create their own skins to showcase their style. You can also purchase skins/skin packs from the Minecraft store.</p>
