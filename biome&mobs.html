            <h2>What Biomes Are There?</h2>
            <h3>Overworld Biomes</h3>
            <p>Types of Plains</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plains - A relatively flat area that may have some trees. You can find villages and farm animals like horses.</li>
                <li>Ice Plains - Also called snowy tundra. It's a snow and ice-covered area with vey few trees that is mostly flat but has some hills.</li>
                <li>Ice Spike Plains - A variant of the ice plains that have large icy spikes and glaciers that reach into the sky.</li>
                <li>Sunflower Plains - The only biome where sunflowers spawn.</li>
                <li>Snowy Plains - A snow-covered area that can have rabbits, polar bears, and strays. Igloos may generate.</li>
                <li>Mushroom Field - An island made of mycelium where big mushrooms grow frequently.</li>
                <li>Savanna - A flat, dry area that has acacia trees and lots of tall grass.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Woodlands</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Forest - Areas filled with oak and birch trees. Mushrooms, flowers, and wolves can also appear.</li>
                <li>Birch Forest - Variant of the forest where only birch trees appear. Wolves do not spawn here.</li>
                <li>Dark Forest - Forest variant filled with dark oak trees. The trees are often packed close enough together that they cover the sky, letting hostile mobs spawn even during the daytime. Woodland mansions exclusively appear in this biome.</li>
                <li>Flower Forest - Less trees appear in these forests, but are replaced with tons of flowers, some exclusive to these biomes. Rabbits replace wolves in these areas.</li>
                <li>Old Growth Birch Forest - A birch forest, but the trees are much taller.</li>
                <li>Taiga - A forest of spruce trees that is populated by ferns, berry bushes, foxes, and rabbits.</li>
                <li>Old Growth Spruce Taiga - Variant of the taiga where giant spruce trees are covered in leaf blocks.</li>
                <li>Old Growth Pine Taiga - Variant of the taiga that has taller and wider spruce trees. Mossy cobblestone and podzol can be found in these areas.</li>
                <li>Snowy Taiga - A taiga variant covered in snow. Igloos can generate in these areas.</li>
                <li>Jungle - A dense area of tall jungle tree. Vines commonly drape down many blocks you can find ocelots, parrots, pandas, cocas, and melons in these areas.</li>
                <li>Bamboo Jungle - A jungle absolutely covered in large trees and thickets of bamboo. Pandas spawn in this area more often.</li>
                <li>Sparse Jungle - A much less dense variation of the jungle. All the same things appear, but there is more space between everything.</li>
                <li>Grove - A forest of spruce trees that appear at the bottom of mountains when near a forest biome. THere is a lot of snow and powder snow along the floor.</li>
                <li>Cherry Grove - An area where cherry trees generated. They are easy to distinguish by their pink leave blocks that have petals that fall to the ground.</li>
                <li>Pale Garden - A dark, desolate area where no mobs spawn besides the creaking, a wooden creature that attacks when you're not looking and can't be defeated by attacking it directly. Find the pale oak wood set and pale moss items here.</li>
